## üß† Project Overview

This project implements:
- Binary and multiclass **Logistic Regression** using gradient descent
- Multiclass **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** using hinge loss
- Comparison of performance metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix)
- Classification of digits using the **MNIST** dataset

No external machine learning libraries like `TensorFlow`, `PyTorch`, or `Keras` are used.
