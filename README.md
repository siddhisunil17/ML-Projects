# ðŸ¤– ML Projects Repository

This repository showcases my hands-on implementations of key **machine learning algorithms** as part of the coursework for **CSE574: Introduction to Machine Learning** at the University at Buffalo (Spring 2025).

Each project is implemented **from scratch in Python**, without using external machine learning libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects Included

### ðŸ§  [Project 1: Handwritten Digit Classification](./Project_1_Handwritten_Digit_Classification)

- Implements a simple neural network with one hidden layer
- Trains on the MNIST dataset using forward/backpropagation and gradient descent
- Avoids any deep learning frameworks

### ðŸ“Š [Project 2: Regression & Classification](./Project2-Regression-Classification)

- Explores fundamental statistical learning models:
  - LDA and QDA (classification)
  - OLS and Ridge Regression (regression)
- Includes non-linear regression using polynomial expansion
- Visual analysis and comparison of model performance

### ðŸ“ˆ [Project 3: Logistic Regression & SVM](./Project_3_LogisticRegression_SVM)

- Implements multiclass logistic regression using One-vs-Rest strategy
- Builds Support Vector Machine classifier with hinge loss
- Includes performance evaluation and final video presentation

---

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- Python (Core ML logic, CLI scripts)
- NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
- MATLAB `.mat` files for dataset inputs

---

## ðŸ“Ž Notes

- Due to GitHub file size restrictions, large `.mat` files (e.g., `mnist_all.mat`) are not uploaded.
- Descriptions and video walkthroughs are included where available.
- All work was done as part of course assignments, fully implemented from first principles.
